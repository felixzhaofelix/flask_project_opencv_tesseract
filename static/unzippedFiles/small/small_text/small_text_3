After eight years, Republicans take control of Senate

Experts predict
worsening gridlock
in Washington

By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor

After eight years in the
minority, the Republican Party
has regained control of the U.S.
Senate.

Seven Republican  candi-
dates have captured Democrat-
ic seats in Arkansas, Colorado,
Towa, Montana, North Carolina,
South Dakota and West Vir-
ginia. The Republican majority
could widen, pending a Decem-
ber runoff in the Louisiana sen-
ate race.

For the first time since 1994,
Republicans will control both
houses of Congress with a Dem-
ocratic president in the White
House.

Both of Michigan’s Senate
seats remain in Democratic
hands. In a race that was once
seen as a potential pick-up for
the Republicans, U.S. Rep. Gary
Peters (D-14th District) secured
a widening lead over Republican
challenger Terri Lynn Land,
former Michigan Secretary of
State.

With the turnover of the
Senate, Michigan’s U.S. Senator
Debbie Stabenow (D) will lose
her chairmanship of the U.S.
Senate Committee on Agricul-
ture, Nutrition and Forestry.
Committee chairs wield consid-

erable power in setting the legis-
lative agenda, which could mean
decreased state clout in the Sen-
ate and diminished influence for
Michigan’s delegation.
Stabenow is one of 17 sena-
tors who was in office in 2006,
the last time
Republicans
held a majori-
ty in the upper
house.
In an inter-
view with The
Michigan Daily,
Political
ence Prof. Mike

Sci-
Traugott said
the
signals a future

turnover

of increased partisan gridlock in
Congress.

“We're in for two years of
severe gridlock in Washington,”
he said. “If we thought the cur-
rent congress was unproductive,
it will be nothing compared to
the next one.”

Though Republicans will

have the ability to move legisla-
tion through both houses with

increased ease, the proposals
will likely meet the president’s
veto. Traugott said securing
enough votes to overturn those
vetoes will be extremely diffi-
cult.

Though the executive and
legislative
branches have
been divided
in the past,
Traugott said
the
ingly
ized _ political

increas-
polar-

culture could
further hinder
the
ty of enacting

possibili-

bi-partisan
legislation or confirming White
House judicial and executive

branch appointments.

“There used to be a substan-
tial numbers of senators willing
to cross lines to reach compro-
mise and now we're in the situ-
ation where’s there’s almost no
voting across party lines,” he
said.

Aaron Kall, director of the
University’s debate team and an
expert on election politics, said
he is not certain the new compo-
sition represents a sure-fire sign
of additional gridlock. While he
said heightened partisanship
could cause increased gridlock,
he said there is also the potential
for the shift to promote compro-
mise.

“It could go either way,” he
said.

With two years left in his

presidency, Kall said President
Barack Obama may have an
incentive to move more legis-
lation through Congress as he
tries to shape his legacy with
some final pieces of signature
legislation.

“The election result tonight
could be the impetus for a
broader congressional agenda,
more legislation being passed
and the government being more
functional,” he said. “I’m pretty
optimistic we could see that in
the next few years.”

However, Kall said Republi-
can gains could be short-lived.
If gridlock continues, there
could be plenty of Republican
senators trying to defend their
seats in traditionally blue states
by 2016.

claims victory in A? mayoral race

Two incumbents,
three newcomers
elected to Council

By EMMA KERR

Daily Staff Reporter
Christopher Taylor was
elected mayor of Ann Arbor
Tuesday night in a landslide
victory, earning 84.21 percent
of the vote. His competitor,
independent candidate Bryan
Kelly, garnered 4,728 votes,
approximately 15.34 percent of
the vote.

Along with Taylor’s assump-
tion of the mayoral seat, City
Councilmembers Sumi Kailas-
apathy (D-Ward 1) and Chuck
Warpehoski (D-Ward 5) were
reelected as incumbents, in
addition to the three coun-
cilmembers elect Julie Grand
(D-Ward 1), Graydon Kraphol
(D-Ward 3) and Kirk Westphal
(D-Ward 2).

“T am just so excited to have
been elected mayor,’ Taylor
said. “It is a great honor and
Ann Arbor is such a wonderful
place; I am thrilled and hon-
ored. The city is really going
in the right track. I think we
are making progress just tak-
ing care of the basics as well as
improving people’s way of life.
We've got a lot to do, we’re not
perfect, but I think these areas
are going in the right direc-
tion.”

Since the declaration of his
candidacy in December 2013,
Taylor spent more money than
any other candidate in this
highly contested race. Though
his campaign came toascreech-
ing halt in August, he raised a
total of $75,698 in the months
preceding the primary. Fellow
Councilmembers Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3), Sabra Bri-
ere (D- Ward 1) and Sally Hart
Petersen (D-Ward 2) all ran in
the Democratic Primary along-
side Taylor, who carried 47.57
percent of the vote.

really got her message across.”

In remarks to the media
Tuesday night, Peters charac-
terized his win as the result of
months of traveling the state
and building out grassroots
efforts.

As an independent candi-
date, Kelly’s goal in the elec-
tion was not entirely to win,
but rather to spark debate and
turn an uncontested, one-party
election into an opportunity for
further discussion of the issues
surrounding the city. Following
the announcement of his can-
didacy in July, Kelly did little
campaigning and focused on
developing his position on the
issues themselves through his
website and various mayoral
debates.

Taylor said while his victory
was not a surprise, Kelly took
initiative and showed a passion
for local politics.

“T think that it is a democra-
cy and people who want to run
can and chose to run, and he did
make that decision and I hope
that it was an experience that
met his expectations,” Taylor
said.

Taylor is currently in his
third term as a city coun-
cilmember representing Ward
3. As the first new mayor in 14
years, Taylor has positioned
himself to follow in current
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieft-
je’s footsteps. His approach
to key issues in this election,
which
University and city relations

include development,
and addressing infrastructure
needs, echo that of Hieftje’s.

For Kelly, he said the race
was a good experience, generat-
ing thoughtful debate about the
issues in Ann Arbor while keep-
ing a lighthearted atmosphere.
On top of that, Kelly said he was
happy to see his work didn’t go
unnoticed.

“I did not know what to
expect and it feels really good
when you’re an independent
to see 5,000 people vote for
you because that means 5,000
people took the time to bubble
in your name,” Kelly said. “I
feel like even as a newcomer to
politics, this is a very welcome
development. Chris obviously
received a lot more, and that
makes sense, but I’m thrilled

“IT take the job of being a
representative very seriously,
which means being in the com-
munity, being accessible, lis-
tening to folks, and I think that
paid off today,” he said. “I think
they were looking for someone
who is out there working to
earn the right to represent the
people of Michigan in Wash-
ington D.C.”

Kelly added that he is still
interested in city government.

Taylor considers himself to
have a balanced and _ practi-
cal approach to development,
considering each  construc-
tion opportunity individually
and seeking to amend current
zoning to better represent the
needs of the city.

Attending the University as
an undergraduate and a law
student, his perspective on
town-gown relations centers on
communication. Taylor said he
expects to meet with Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel
next week to discuss issues sur-
rounding the University’s rela-
tionship with the city.

Furthermore, Taylor rec-
ognized infrastructure to be
one of the key issues following
last winter’s harsh conditions.
He said this is in many ways

on a platform focused on his
record on the economy, climate
change and women’s issues.

last month for a one-year mill-
age that would be levied on
Washtenaw County residents

ing roads. While Taylor said his
experience has prepared him to
become mayor, there will still
be new challenges.

“Ym well-versed in present
issues having been a coun-
cilmember, but there are natu-
rally alot of things a mayor does
that I have never done that will
be new,” Taylor said.

Taylor said a private swear-
ing in will occur next Monday
and the public event will come
at his first council meeting as
mayor Nov. 17th.

New councilmembers Grand,
Kraphol, and Westphal all ran
unopposed in the general elec-
tion, but Grand said they used
this time between the primary
and the time when they will
take their seat on council to get
an early start learning the ropes
of city council.

“There are three of us who
are all running unopposed, so
we have started orientation
early. There is going to be a
learning curve,” Grand said.
“We’ve had a couple meet-
ings with the city attorney, but
things like legal details can’t be
learned in just a brief orienta-
tion.”

Westphal said in the next
few weeks, communication will
be key as he begins his time on
city council.

“There are some clear signs
that Ann Arbor is going through
some evolution,” Westphal said.
“T encourage collaboration and
coming together to see what
Ann Arbor will look like in the
future, so to the extent that we
can keep everything that is spe-
cial about Ann Arbor and yet
welcome more people here and
more opportunity, the better.”

for an increase to the minimum
wage. His campaign also sought

to create a distinction between
him and Land on pay equity

poorly attended
across campus

Results are in across the
country for the midterm elec-
tion — historically known for
lower voter turnouts than presi-
dential years. However, Univer-
sity students braved the rain to
cast their ballots at polling loca-
tions throughout campus.

According to a poll by the
Harvard Institute of Politics,
only 26 percent of young voters
said they would “definitely vote”
prior to the election, similar to
the 27-percent proportion in the
2010 midterm elections.

Of college students, 31 per-
cent said they would definitely
vote.

Larry Kestenbaum, Washt-
enaw County Clerk and Reg-
ister of Deeds, said relatively
low voter turnout among young
people could be attributed to
campaigns and advertising that
wasn't targeted toward them.

Kestenbaum said this law was a

was futile to attempt to market
to young voters.

Arbor resident Lisa Jibson, a
poll volunteer, said many stu-
dents tried to vote Tuesday who
could not. They were registered
in a district outside of Ann

“We've had to redirect quite
a few,” Jibson said. “We hate to
have anyone feel like they didn’t
get the chance to vote.”

LSA freshman Cole Zingas

to vote regardless of party lines,
and voted for mostly Democrats

“I just didn’t believe Mark

plan for the state,” he said. “I
liked what Rick Snyder did the
last few years in Michigan.”

Snyder’s willingness to break

the principles laid out in his
first campaign. A former chief
executive of computer com-
pany Gateway and a venture
capitalist, Snyder entered
the 2010 gubernatorial race
as a relative unknown and a
political novice. His pledge to
put politics aside and instead
use his business acumen to
improve the state appealed
to voters, as he sailed to an
18-point victory over Demo-
crat Virg Bernero.

“It’s time to drop the labels

raphy,” Snyder said in his 2010
victory speech. “To make this

she said.

LSA senior Gabe Leaf, chair
of the University’s chapter of
the College Republicans, said
he was chiefly concerned with
reducing unemployment and
expanding Michigan’s economy.
His vote for Snyder stemmed
from the governor’s gradual
increases in funding higher edu-
cation.

“He’s a Michigan man him-
self,” Leaf said. “He comes from
us; he knows what we’ve been
through, the kind of struggles

Race for regent
too close to call

Republicans lead
in early results,
but Democrats
remain hopeful

By CLAIRE BRYAN and
ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporters

As of 2 a.m. Wednesday, the
race for two contested spots
on the University’s Board of
Regents was too close to call.

Republicans Rob Steele and
Ronald Weiser lead with 596,732
and 594,196 votes, respective-
ly, compared to Democrats
Mike Behm’s 440,903 votes
and incumbent Kathy White’s
477,101 votes.

Early Wednesday morning,
the Michigan Secretary of State
had yet to release final tallies
from several counties, including
the heavily Democratic Genesee
and Wayne Counties that con-
tain Flint and Detroit.

In 2012, the final election
results were not determined
until the following day. In that
year, the two Republican can-
didates led for most of the early
morning hours, but fell to Dem-
ocrats once votes from Wayne
County were tallied.

The board’s two open seats
are currently held by Regent
Julia Darlow (D), who is not
seeking reelection, and White.

White, who currently serves
as chair of the Board of Regents,
is a professor of law at Wayne
State University Law School in
Detroit, an instructor of law at
the United States Military Acad-
emy at West Point in New York
and a Lieutenant Colonel in the
United States Army Reserve.

Weiser founded McKinley
Associates, a commercial real
estate company, and served on
multiple boards for nonprof-
it organizations including the
United Negro College Fund of
Washtenaw County, the Henry
Ford Museum in Dearborn and
the Detroit Institute of Arts.
He also served as the Amer-
ican ambassador to the Slo-
vak Republic under the Bush
Administration.

Steele, a University Inteflex
program alum, is a cardiologist
at St. Joseph Mercy Health Sys-
tem in Ypsilanti and served as
a clinical assistant professor at
the University for more than 20
years.

Behm works as a litigator in
Flint and served as president of
the Michigan Association for
Justice in 2011, a trade asso-
ciation. He worked on former
Secretary of State Hillary Clin-
ton’s presidential campaign and
served as a delegate to the Dem-
ocratic National Convention in
2008.

The eight-member board is
elected for eight-year terms on
the statewide ballot. The board
is currently composed of six
Democrats and two Republi-
cans.

In 2012, Democrats Mark
Bernstein and Shauna Ryder
Diggs won the two open seats
on the board, carried to victory
in part by the presidential race
at the top of the ticket. Similar-
ly, Republicans Andrea Fischer
Newman and Andrew Richner
won the election in 2010, a year
that saw low Democratic turn-
out and the election of Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder.

In this election cycle, all four
major-party candidates empha-
sized affordability in their plat-

forms, but differed on their
plans for its execution.

Steele had said he planned to
finance student loans by tapping
into the University’s endow-
ment, while White said she
intended to strengthen financial
aid. Behm and Weiser see the
University’s satellite campuses
in Dearborn and Flint as addi-
tional, more affordable options
for students and said they plan
to strengthen these campuses.

Earlier this month, the candi-
dates met for a candidate forum
at the Gerald R. Ford School of
Public Policy to discuss a variety
of University issues, including
campus climate, the institution’s
response to sexual assault and
working with the city of Detroit.

Most of the candidates shared
similar views on these issues,
such as going to greater lengths
to aid survivors of sexual assault
and working to increase diver-
sity among students within
the boundaries of Proposal 2,
the 2006 ballot initiative that
banned consideration of race in
college admissions. Behm also
expressed support for the Uni-
versity’s financial divestment
from fossil fuel companies.

In the last year, the regents
have been involved in several
significant decisions, including
the appointment of University
President Mark Schlissel.

Political Science Prof. Vin-
cent Hutchings said regent
candidates typically don’t gain
as much publicity compared to
other races.

“These lower-level offices put
a bigger burden on the voter,”
Hutchings said. “It is harder
for people to gain information
about these people because
information in the media is less
plentiful.”

Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
vice president

versity’s for

government relations, ran
unsuccessfully for regent in
1986.

“It was a great experience, but
I think what you learn quickly is
that the visibility of the regent
races is really pretty low in the
electorate,” she said.

For that reason, Wilbanks
said the results in regents races
are sometimes driven by the top
of the ticket, particularly when
voters cast straight-ticket bal-
lots.

“Straight party ticket voting
may happen a little more fre-
quently when you are down at
the bottom of the ballot,” Wil-
banks said. “That historical pat-
tern has held true.”

Ina telephone interview with
The Michigan Daily, Regent
Emeritus Frederick C. Matthaei
said he does not think parti-
sanship plays a large role in the
functioning of the board.

Matthaei was appointed
