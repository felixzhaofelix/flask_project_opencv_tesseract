Snyder reelected
to second term

By nearly five point
margin, governor
rides on record to

defeat Schauer

By BEN ATLAS
Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan voters have granted
four more years to the “nerd.”
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
won reelection Tuesday, defeat-
ing Democratic challenger Mark
Schauer ina closer-than-expect-
ed campaign.

With most precincts in the
state reporting, Snyder captured
51 percent of the vote compared
to Schauer’s 47 percent. In the
last few days before the election,
Snyder and Schauer were close
in the polls with the Detroit Free
Press reporting a two-point lead
in Snyder’s favor on Oct. 29.

In his victory speech at the
Renaissance Center in Detroit
Tuesday night, Snyder empha-
sized the economic trouble the
state had long endured and his
efforts to fundamentally change
its course.

“Our spirit was being broken,”

Snyder said. “It was not the time
to fix Michigan; that was not
going to be good enough. It was
time to reinvent Michigan.”

In his speech, Snyder said
there was plenty of evidence of
an economic turnaround. He
pointed to the creation of nearly
300,000 private sector jobs, the
increase in the value of Michi-
gan homes and the greater num-
ber of college graduates taking
jobs in the state as indicators of
success.

Yet despite Snyder’s belief
in the success of his first term,
he maintained there was much
work to be done in the next four
years.

“When you have success like
this what’s the next thing you
need to do? It’s not to stay com-
placent, it’s time to accelerate
and go even faster,” Snyder said.

Snyder hinted at some of
his goals for his second term,
like filling tens of thousands of
skilled trade jobs, helping young
people connect with education
opportunities and improving
access to career technical edu-
cation, all of which he hopes will
lead to more well-paying middle
class jobs.

Four years after running on

a pledge to reinvent Michigan’s
economy, Snyder was able to
secure a second term largely
on his fulfillment of that prom-
ise. His supporters point to his
hands-on approach to Detroit’s
recovery as a signature accom-
plishment of his first term. The
state legislature, the city and its
creditors and pensioners struck
a Grand Bargain that allowed
the city to move ahead with its
bankruptcy proceedings, which
will wrap up this month.

On higher education, Snyder
cut state funding in 2011 with
the promise to raise it again in
subsequent years. He has incre-
mentally increased the funding
but has yet to return it to the 2011
levels. Consequently, Schauer
attempted to brand himself as
the “education governor” in his
campaign, calling for its funding
to be restored to pre-2011 levels
upon election to office.

In terms of the statewide
economy, Snyder repealed the
Michigan Business Tax and
replaced it with a flat tax to
appeal to new businesses, and
each of his last two budgets
have resulted in a surplus. Addi-
tionally, the state’s 7.2-percent

U.S. House Rep. Gary Peters
(D-Detroit) will be the next
U.S Senator from Michigan.

Peters, who has served in the
U.S House of Representatives
for five years, faced off against
Terri Lynn Land, former
Michigan Secretary of State.
The race was called by CNN
and the Detroit Free Press at 9
p.m, and as of press time early
Wednesday morning with 95
percent of precincts reporting,
Peters led Land 55 percent to
41 percent.

Minutes after Peters’ pro-
jected win was announced,
Land called Peters to concede.
She did not release a statement,
talk to the press or speak to
the Republican watch party in

party would be the overall
majority in the Senate.

However, Peters, who main-
tained a slight lead in the polls
over Land throughout much
of the general election season,
pulled away from his opponent
significantly by the last quar-
ter of the race to a double-digit
lead.

“Michigan was obviously a
squandered opportunity for
the Republicans,” Political
Science Prof. Michael Trau-
gott said Tuesday night. “Her
campaign got off to a bad start
because of the initial interac-
tion with the media, so her
campaign team decided to
hide her from reporters and
restricted her access to voters
at public events, so she never
